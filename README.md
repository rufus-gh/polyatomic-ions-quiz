# Polyatomic Ion Quiz

This project is a simple web-based quiz application designed to help users learn and practice the names of polyatomic ions. The quiz displays the chemical formula of a polyatomic ion, and the user must type in its name. The application provides immediate feedback and keeps track of the user's score.

## Features

- Displays the chemical formula of a polyatomic ion.
- Accepts user input for the name of the ion.
- Provides immediate feedback with a popup indicating whether the answer is correct or incorrect.
- Supports both US and British spellings for certain ions (e.g., sulfate/sulphate).
- Keeps track of the number of correct answers and total questions.
- Popups stack vertically in the top right corner and fade out automatically.
